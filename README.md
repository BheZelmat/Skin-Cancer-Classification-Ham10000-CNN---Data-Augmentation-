## üìù Description
- The project "Predicting Medical Costs Billed by Health Insurance" leverages a comprehensive dataset of 1338 entries, encompassing attributes such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, region, and individual medical charges. It aims to analyze how these factors impact medical costs.
 The dataset reflects a broad range of age groups, body mass indices, with an average of about one child per individual, and significant variability in medical expenses.
 Utilizing advanced machine learning models including Neural Networks, Gradient Boosting, Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Ensemble methods, the project seeks to delve into the data, unveiling patterns and correlations.
This endeavor is geared towards facilitating the development of robust predictive models, enabling more precise estimations of health insurance costs based on specific individual attributes.

The dataset contains 1338 entries and 7 columns, each representing different attributes:

* Age: The age of the primary beneficiary (numerical)

* Sex: The policyholder's gender (categorical: male, female)

* BMI: Body mass index (numerical, float)

* Children: Number of children or dependents covered by the health insurance (numerical)

* Smoker: Smoking status of the policyholder (categorical: yes, no)

* Region: The beneficiary's residential area in the US (categorical: northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest)

* Charges: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance (numerical, float)

All columns are fully populated with non-null data. The data types are appropriate for each column (numerical for "age", "bmi", "children", and "charges"; categorical for "sex", "smoker", and "region").
